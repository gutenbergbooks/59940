<h3>
  TO YOU WHO WILL UNDERSTAND<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  You, who have conquered the wilderness,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You, who are building the land,<br />
  You, whom I knew in the loneliness,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To you, who will understand,<br />
  Rhymes I have rhymed of the lonely ways,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stories I tell o'er again&mdash;<br />
  Wandering days by the camp-fire's blaze,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fancy and frolic and pain.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Far in the silence I seem to see<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shadowy forms in the mist,<br />
  Moulding the key of a land to be,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steeled to its terrors resist;<br />
  Daring it all, where the shadows fall,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lengthening far in the night;<br />
  Answering ever to nature's call,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning the darkness to light.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Many will follow, but you must lead<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way o'er the ancient clay,<br />
  Paying the price of a nation's need;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comrades you leave by the way.<br />
  Yet in the future you see a land<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peopled and loved as a home;<br />
  Men who will listen and understand<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your work in the great alone.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Many have judged with a judgment stern<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your pleasures, which e'en are few;<br />
  Judging, with little desire to learn,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of trials they never knew.<br />
  Yet you have chosen, and who shall say<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your choosing was not aright;<br />
  Willing to follow the silent way,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way of the long, long night.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  What will it matter, when comes the call<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To enter the dim unknown?<br />
  What will it matter, when, after all,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You stand at the Master's throne?<br />
  Maybe I dream, but I often seem<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man's judgment to hear reversed;<br />
  "<i>I judge by not what you should have been,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis strange you have not been worse.</i>"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  So have I dreamed of the long ago,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Songs have I sung to your name;<br />
  Little of fancy, to you who know,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of a nation's fame;<br />
  Memories dear to the men who roam,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brothers I knew in the land;<br />
  Leaving the judgment to you alone,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To you, who will understand.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
<a id="never"></a>
  TO YOU WHO CAN NEVER UNDERSTAND<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  You've often, by your fireside, talked of people you have known,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldier, p'raps the doctor, or the priest;<br />
  These verses are of fellows, most of whom are never known,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On whom the limelight falls perhaps the least.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  There's many who've forgotten, in the comfort of a home,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boys whose lives are mingled with the wild;<br />
  Who leave the surging city, model out the great alone,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To hardness, for your pleasure, reconciled.<br />
</p>

<p class="t3">
  * * * * * * *<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  When, lying in your sleeper in a first-class Pullman car,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or musing at the table while you dine,<br />
  The train is running swiftly on without a jolt or jar,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D'you ever think of those who made the line?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  While rushing o'er the prairies, fresh with towns all newly born,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bush, the bridge across the Torrent's fall;<br />
  And rounding mighty canyons in the hazy early morn,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't quite forget the boys who did it all.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  We know you bought a ticket, and you pay for all you get,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But don't you see the shadow near the pine,<br />
  Who looks at you appealingly, with face so white and set,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For duty died, your comfort on the line.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Just turn your eyes to Westward, to the bluff that shades the creek,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sunset's glory setting overhead;<br />
  We found him in the bushes, he'd been frozen near a week,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His life, a pioneer, the man that's dead.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  There's some who die of hunger, and there's others rave in pain;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fever and the scurvy claim their due.<br />
  And many go to early graves, who might have gone to fame.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just think of us while in your family pew.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
<a id="men"></a>
  MEN OF THE LINE<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Sons of the survey, sons of the wild, sons of the<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prodigal son,<br />
  Chums of the lonely and ancient pine, standing<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eternally dumb;<br />
  Knowing the cost of the words "To fail," staking the<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;way in the gloom,<br />
  Dreaming the dream in the dim unseen, daring its<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ravening doom,<br />
  Men who are known by the great alone, men who are<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leading the way,<br />
  Fighting the fight in the long, lone night, loving the<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lure of the fray;<br />
  Reckless and careless, but ever true, men of the track<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the mine,<br />
  Carving to-day 'midst the desert's sway, their names<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the sands of time.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Men with a home that is all in the world, men who<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are fated to stay,<br />
  Roaming the West or the mighty North, building the<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;future to-day;<br />
  Drawing a hand when the world began, playing the<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;game that is set;<br />
  Plans that were born on Creation's morn, wanderers<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wandering yet.<br />
  Counting the stars in the Southern cross, sweltering<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deep in the Rand;<br />
  Blanketed tight in the Arctic night, brothers reclaiming<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the land.<br />
  Fighting a thirst in a land accursed, bringing it<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;honor and fame;<br />
  Shatt'ring its curse, and its fears disperse, men who<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the wilderness tame.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Men who have chosen the lonely way, men who have<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;given the gift,<br />
  Living for us in the lands to come, men who are<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lifting the mist;<br />
  Draining the land on a fevered strand, damming the<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;torrents that pour,<br />
  Leaving their brand on the desert sand, men who have<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;opened the door.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Men who have ravished the wilderness, men who have<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;followed the trail,<br />
  Men who are sleeping the dreamless sleep, far in the<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;innermost pale;<br />
  Never the chant of the abbey's choir, only the wolves<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the night,<br />
  Finding a tomb in the deathless gloom, men who have<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;finished the fight.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  What if they're careless&mdash;are we to judge slips that<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they make in the game?<br />
  If we were men of a survey crew, God help us, we'd<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do the same.<br />
  What if they sin?  Are we free from that: it so, let<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;us throw the stone,<br />
  But few are the men who have kept the ten commands<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the ancient throne.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Men from the college or from the farm, men of the<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wandering breed,<br />
  Men of the 'Varsity's honored roll, men whom the future<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will need;<br />
  Men who are young, and have just begun, soon with<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the wilderness blend,<br />
  Men who are grey in the work to-day, men who are<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nearing the end.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Men still living yet men who are dead, men who are<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;buried at home,<br />
  Living afresh in the loneliness, men who forever must<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;roam;<br />
  Men with a name that is not the same as once in the<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;days gone by,<br />
  Men who have come with a secret dumb, men who have<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;severed the tie.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  We who have followed the beaten track, we who have<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chosen the home,<br />
  We who have never desired to stray, to fathom the<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mystic zone;<br />
  Spirits who dwell in a conquered sphere, deaf to the<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wandering call,<br />
  Honor the men of the wilderness, men who have given<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their all.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  All for the years that are yet to come, sowers who<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;never will reap,<br />
  Send thro' the darkness the call of dawn, waking<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eternity's sleep;<br />
  Hard in the hardness of harder things, hardness we<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;never have seen,<br />
  Men who have finished the Master's work, bridging the<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;space between.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  We, who must reap of their toil to-day, harvesting<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seed they have sown,<br />
  Are we forgetting the price they paid, these heroes<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we've never known?<br />
  Are we neglecting the debt we owe, the debt we can<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ne'er repay,<br />
  Carelessly viewing their finished work, indifferently on<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our way?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Sons of the Survey, sons of the wild, sons of the<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prodigal son,<br />
  Boys who are treading the lonely way, fellows of whom<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have sung;<br />
  Let us remember the deeds they've done, leaving<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forever their name,<br />
  Lettered in gold, and the story told, for aye on the<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scroll of fame.<br />

  (The Spirit of the Land to the Old Pioneer)<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Out of the vastness I heard a voice<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That echoed from sea to sea,<br />
  Singing the song of the olden years,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The song of the years to be;<br />
  Tender and sad, as it sought its way,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through hovel to banquet hall,<br />
  Seeking for those who would understand,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The love of the mother call.<br />
</p>

<p class="t3">
  * * * * * * *<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I see you in turreted mansions,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My children of long ago,<br />
  I see you as derelicts drifting,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As wrecks on the rivers flow;<br />
  And I call, with a soul o'erflowing,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forsaken, but yearning yet,<br />
  To hold you again to my bosom,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The child I can ne'er forget.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Long have I waited for your return<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As faces have come and gone,<br />
  Long have I brooded o'er silent camps,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Midst trails that your feet have worn:<br />
  Waiting in vain, for I see you now<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too old for the lonely trail,<br />
  And I in my sorrow must leave you,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My children, who did not fail.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Fain would I hold you close to my breast,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My child of the vanished years,<br />
  Where is the love that is true as mine,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mingled with sorrowing tears?<br />
  Ah, how I miss you, mid'st faces new,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;True, daring, but not the same,<br />
  'Tis you, ever you, who have left me<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alone who can soothe my pain.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  When they shall come, and shall speak your name,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In honor, amid my gloom,<br />
  Then will I fight as a she-wolf fights,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To guard them against the doom;<br />
  For you were my children before them,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your dreams shall be theirs again,<br />
  And I, whom you followed, will cherish<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The men who shall breathe your name.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Farewell, as I leave you in sorrow,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet joy, for your stent is done;<br />
  Farewell, till I greet you through others<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who further your toil begun.<br />
  O'er trails where we wrought together<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more shall your footsteps wend,<br />
  But I in the silence shall wait you,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rewarding you at the end.<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chords of the old desire;<br />

  THE RODMAN'S DREAM<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  I dreamed that the trumpet had sounded,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Judgment we went to on high,<br />
  By bands of the angels surrounded,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hurried away to the sky;<br />
  Some fellows wore scared-looking faces,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And some had a wondering look,<br />
  But stood all arranged in our places,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And watched as they opened the book.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  We never had read much about it,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And seldom attended the kirk,<br />
  The judgment we heard, never doubt it,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was, "Man should be judged by his work";<br />
  We hadn't done much we were proud of,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except for the road or the mine,<br />
  But Mac said, if it was allowed of,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We'd build them a heavenly line.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The draughtsman was fitted with paper<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They took from the memory book,<br />
  The transit and stand came from Peter,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who down on the earth used to look:<br />
  The rod was supplied and a level.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With one other thing to get yet,<br />
  The chain we got loaned from the devil,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hubs we proceeded to set.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  We hunted the children of Israel,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ordered them out on the line,<br />
  And Aaron, with Jonah and Ishmael,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All helped us to build it on time;<br />
  We fixed up the Ark for a cookshack,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Installing the devil as cook,<br />
  We knew he could fix up the hard tack,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From reading of him in the book.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  We tore up the golden pavements,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sighted through jasper walls,<br />
  Upsetting the angels' arrangements,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shocking their ears with our calls.<br />
  Lot handled a back-flagging picket,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rod Moses used at the rock,<br />
  And put a B.M. at the wicket,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where incoming pilgrims would knock.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Mere Eve watched, with angels beside her,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Adam the foreman we made;<br />
  And took the Pale Horse and his rider<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To drive a machine on the grade.<br />
  I've worked on the C.P. and others,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And often seen queer-looking sights;<br />
  But laughed when the Zebedee brothers<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drove mules in the heavenly heights.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  King Solomon sent us a tender,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A house for the agent to build,<br />
  And Matthew, our legal defender,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw specifications were filled;<br />
  We put up a gold cantilever,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'erspanning the Valley of Rest,<br />
  And hunted up old Shalmanezar,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For laying the steel in the West.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  We worked, for we knew it depended<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where we should Eternity spend;<br />
  Our future we stoutly defended,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The line that we made at The End.<br />
  That grade never needed inspection,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such filling we never had seen;<br />
  Pure silver and gold for a section,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With radium stuffed in between.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  We showed, when the road was completed,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our duty we never would shirk;<br />
  And the Master who viewed it repeated:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That man should be judged by his work."<br />
  He called up the saints of the ages,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To honor us with their esteem,<br />
  And pardoned our past-blotted pages&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I woke, and I found 'twas a dream.<br />

  THE MUSTERING OF THE LEGION
</h3>

<p class="t3">
  (To the Legion of Frontiersmen)<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  <i>'Twas a dream that I dreamed of to-morrow,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A shadow was cast before,<br />
  And the men who were missing had gathered<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To answer the call to war.<br />
  Did ye think they were dead to the Empire?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, no, though their trail is dim!<br />
  On the roll of the Legion you'll find them,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Frontiersmen of the King.</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I dreamed that a land was in sore distress,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I dreamed of a great review,<br />
  And the frontiersmen from across the sea<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had gathered, a motley crew;<br />
  For the word had flown to the rolling stone<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That perilled was England's name;<br />
  From the North and South, to the East and West<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They listened, and then they came.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  They came from the north, the Alaskan coast,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They came from the White Man's Grave,<br />
  The men of the ranch and the mounted police,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In company with the knave;<br />
  Forgetting it all at the nation's call,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unmindful of aught beside,<br />
  They were needed there, there were none to spare,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In stemming disaster's tide.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Not a smile was seen, as the strange array<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was mustered, and still they came<br />
  From the Southern Cross and the midnight sun,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The desert and from the plain:<br />
  They came from the mountains and Grosvenor Square,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trapper beside the knight,<br />
  The men of the jungle and Labrador,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In eagerness for the fight.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  They came in detachments, they came alone,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They paid or they worked their way,<br />
  In moccasins, chaps, or in overalls,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young with the old and grey:<br />
  Their law was the law of the <i>Forty-four</i>,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And grimly across the waves<br />
  They came, for the King was in need of them,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His men of the damn-fool trades.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  They came from the mist of a future dawn,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lands of to-morrow's sun;<br />
  The lands that in exile and weariness<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had awaited the man to come.<br />
  They came from the shade of a Moslem mosque,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The desert of long ago;<br />
  These men who had welcomed the Legion's call,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their loyalty e'en to show.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  They came from the shanty and lumber camp,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They came from a prairie shack,<br />
  The office and camp of the engineers,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Irishman and the Mac;<br />
  They came from the land of the Golden Fleece,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And far from an Indian shore,<br />
  Obeying the word that was passed along,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Frontiersman's call to war.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  For the call had reached, God alone knew how,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Britons beyond the seas<br />
  Caught its wailing cry, as it passed them by,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Borne on by the evening breeze;<br />
  In the fevered zone, or the Northern home,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er wilderness, dark and bare,<br />
  It spoke, and its note was o'er-pregnant,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With weariness, pain, and care.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Then I seemed to be in a land of strife,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Britain against the wall,<br />
  Where the pride of an empire was falling<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For ever beyond recall;<br />
  And the flag that had waved in its glory<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was drooping amid the gloom.<br />
  'Twas the end, and I fancied I heard it,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The song of Britannia's doom.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  But its notes were hushed, as with, vengeance flushed,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In anger, the Legion came,<br />
  Like a surging sea, for a moment free,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Avengers of England's fame;<br />
  And the flag was saved, but the lonely graves<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recorded the price they paid,<br />
  Ere the work of the Legion was ended,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doom of an Empire stayed.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And, then, thro' the mist of the cordite's gloom,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw them return again,<br />
  But many who gathered were missing now,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And others were streaked with pain:<br />
  For the desert would grieve for her children,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plains would resound no more<br />
  With the voices of they who were sleeping<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afar on that awful shore.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  They turned them again to the wilderness<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like shadows amid the night,<br />
  Away to the silence and lonely camp,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For ever from England's sight;<br />
  But they heard the call, and the ones to fall<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remembered throughout their pain,<br />
  When the King was in need of their service<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The King had not called in vain.<br />

  THE DESERTED COAST<br />

</p>

<p class="poem">
  Alone, yes, alone, a deserted coast,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though once I was lord of all;<br />
  A king, and a fear, in the Southern Sea,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To men who obeyed my call.<br />
  Yet long was my reign, and my triumphs great,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In days that are dead and gone;<br />
  And now I am waiting, my voices dumb,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A giant of my glory shorn.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I know they are passing me in the North<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By way of the great canal,<br />
  And mocking the passage around the Cape,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where I and my victims dwell;<br />
  Forsaken, undone, but I wait my chance,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With wanderers, sorely pressed,<br />
  The ones who at last will my boundaries pass,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To fall on my waiting breast.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Alone, but for one who will ever sail,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For aye in my mighty grasp;<br />
  The Dutchman, who, trying to round my coast,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was felled by my raging blast;<br />
  For the story's true of the spectral crew<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who wander amid the gloom,<br />
  While my surges sing a deathless hymn,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The song of the Dutchman's doom.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  He'd a mighty ship, and he dared my wrath<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With haughty contempt and pride,<br />
  And a scornful sneer, which I turned to fear<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As vainly escape he tried;<br />
  Well I knew his woe, as he tried to go,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of my raging storm,<br />
  With a bragging curse, which could not disperse<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fear that was in him born.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  How I drew him on, and the moonlight shone<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On faces so drawn and white,<br />
  And I mocked the care that was written there<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aloud in my wild delight;<br />
  There was naught to save from my grave,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I watched them, as one by one<br />
  To my rest were borne, in the early morn,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Believing their work was done.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Then a fancy came, for my future fame,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To tell of their deathless doom,<br />
  So I sent the ship in its ceaseless trip,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A phantom amid the gloom;<br />
  And the story's spread of the restless dead&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They call it the ship of hell&mdash;<br />
  But I held it fast, when the others passed<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Away to the great canal.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  For the Dutchman said that, alive or dead,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He'd conquer amidst the storm,<br />
  And I've heard them tell, in the depths of hell,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of spectres that then were born;<br />
  They with me agreed he should ne'er be freed<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till proving his reckless vow;<br />
  And he's sailing yet, with his royals set.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In anguish I see him now.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  If he knew the way of the ships to-day,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Suez they mock me still,<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His boast he could e'en fulfill.<br />
  If he knew his vow could be proven now<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How gladly he'd say farewell,<br />

  THE RHYME OF THE ROLLING STONE<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  "The stone that rolleth ne'er shall find<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moss, no substance make,"<br />
  Was written by the prophet old,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who words of wisdom spake;<br />
  But, shadowed 'midst its shady bed,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stone of mossy store<br />

  And rolling stones shall find no moss,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is wisdom understood;<br />
  But where the voice of Empire calls,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moss is parched and dry,<br />
  And we are rolling on our way<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath a burning sky.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Twas planned and modelled from the first,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That we should pioneer,<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The desert's nameless fear;<br />
  And from the East unto the West,<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadows slant the sand,<br />
  As rivetters of Empire, we're<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fellows you have damned;<br />
  You'll find us where the Islam priest<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is chanting at the dawn,<br />
  Or throwing out the challenge, on<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A crystal Arctic morn.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  You'll find us running surveys on<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creation's ragged end,<br />
  Or camping in the desert, where<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The past and future blend;<br />
  We're busy building railways on<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The map's deserted spot,<br />
  Or staking out an empire in<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The land that God forgot.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  We haven't failed, tho' p'raps we're not<br />

  It takes a lot to make a world, all classes and all kinds,<br />

  Have you ever cursed at the Master's work, when life's<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;been a sort of hell?<br />
  If so, then perhaps you will understand the story I'm<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;going to tell;<br />
  There are chaps you know who have never seen the<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;edge of a thing called life,<br />
  And have never known of the challenge thrown in the<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;darkness of the strife.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  There's a land we knew in the days of old, when we<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trudged the wilderness,<br />
  'Twas the land of pain, with the brand of Cain, the<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;home of the loneliness;<br />
  We had cursed it oft with the blackest curse, a<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reckless and godless lot,<br />
  And headed our letters for going home, "the country<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that God forgot."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  We had all been out since the early Spring, and things<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had been going wrong,<br />
  And it seemed misfortune had dogged our trail each<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;day, as it dragged along;<br />
  It appeared to be as an alien land, forsaken by God<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and man,<br />
  Till we heard the voice of the one who gave it birth<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when the world began.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  We had cursed that day more than e'er before, as<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fellows in anger do,<br />
  And a storm that gathered above us broke, soaking us<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;through and through;<br />
  As we tramped it back to the lonely camp, it seemed<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that place was banned,<br />
  And Brown with an awful curse had said "The devil<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;controls the land."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Then the thunder rolled, and the lightning flashed,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with its wondrous lurid glow,<br />
  And we who had challenged the wilderness wandered<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the earth below.<br />
  It seemed that a message was from above, the<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;knowledge of endless things,<br />
  The power that quickens the soul of man, and models<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the hearts of kings.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I remember as though 'twere yesterday, the lesson we<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;learnt that night,<br />
  The answer that broke on our startled ears, the voice<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the riven height.<br />
  The God we had challenged with angry words was<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;guarding and watching yet,<br />
  And loving the wilderness we had cursed, the God who<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;could not forget.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  He knew of the lonely location crew, away in the<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shadowed past,<br />
  He knew of the road we had come to build, reserving<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it to the last.<br />
  He knew we would say He had long forgot the arid<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and thirsty land,<br />
  But spoke from the heavens that night to show 'twas<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even as He had planned.<br />

  There's a trail that lies a-waiting<br />

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are things you dream,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they often seem<br />
  To have happened real and true,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the story which<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am going to pitch<br />
  He told while he stirred the stew.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had got his name<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When at first he came<br />
  To cook on a grading pike,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had just one leg<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a lumber peg,<br />
  So they called him Wooden Mike.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The things he had done<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his traps and gun,<br />
  Were wonderful to relate.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But strangest of all<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was once in the fall,<br />
  This story I heard him state.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had gone that fall,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At an urgent call,<br />
  To cook for a lumber firm,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where he worked so quick<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he had to lick<br />
  His hands so they wouldn't burn.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he fried the cakes,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That a fellow makes<br />
  For breakfast, the griddle style,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To have worked the way<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That they do to-day<br />
  Would have taken quite awhile.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he hired a man<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For to grease the pan,<br />
  Its size would be hard to beat;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the guy would skate<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right across the plate<br />
  With bacon rinds on his feet.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I wondered much<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I thought of such,<br />
  And asked him about the fire;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount it took<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the stuff to cook,<br />
  The fuel that it would require.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he scratched his head<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he quietly said<br />
  The amount he'd clean forgot,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he understood<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he used more wood<br />
  Than ever the comp'ny got.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he made his pie<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He would never try<br />
  To finish them one by one;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With an oven large<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a young garage,<br />
  The baking was quickly done.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his pies all lined,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the man behind,<br />
  They close to the oven drew,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He would throw the pie<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the other guy,<br />
  Which baked as it travelled through.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He'd a cycle path<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was made of lath<br />
  Where the men at dinner sat,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the waiter rode<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a ready load<br />
  Of eatables on his back.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was soaked with grease,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he couldn't cease,<br />
  For washing to think about,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he lined his bunk<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With some sandy junk<br />
  To keep him from slipping out.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had lost his leg,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While at sea he said&mdash;<br />
  Got wrecked on a desert isle,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the cannibals,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the animals<br />
  Had given themselves the bile.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They had tried to eat<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of Mike's own meat,<br />
  And one of his legs prepared,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they found the stuff<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was exceeding tough,<br />
  So that's why his life was spared.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Now I don't ask you.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To believe it's true,<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I with him agreed,<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the fences fade from view we take their hand.<br />
  Vessels marred within the moulding, men we turn<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them out at last,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hard and daring, sealed forever with the brand.<br />

<p class="poem">
  Some have drunk the dregs of pleasure, some have<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stroked a winning eight&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drifting derelicts, they seek the lonely way.<br />
  One by one they swell the number, one by one, the toys<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of fate<br />
  One by one ye knew them once&mdash;'twas yesterday.<br />

<p class="poem">
  We are men of many nations, but what matter blood or creed<br />

  We are parted for a season&mdash;in that season one has gone<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was born<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he sought and trailed with us the great alone.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  He's the goal of seeking mammas, he's the idol of the fair,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his past transgressions buried out of sight.<br />
  He's forgot his beans and bacon in a theatre supper's glare,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his days he's mostly living in the night.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Still we took him as a comrade, asking nothing, judging less,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of many whom you send us o'er the foam.<br />
  O'er the singing sands of Egypt, to the Northland's icy breast,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the lonely lands the past to e'en atone.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  So we never ask them questions, for the story's e'er the same,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before the dying campfire's dusky glow<br />
  In the silence they have told us how they played and<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lost the game;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why remember?  E'en forget, 'twas long ago.<br />

  THE PRICE OF THE LINE<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Only three and a starving dog, surveying, my God! my God!<br />
  And all the rest who had started were lying beneath the sod.<br />
  All gone but three, the three of us, it couldn't be very long<br />
  Before the wild would sing again its cursedly mocking song.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  It seemed as though we once had dreamed of the<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;careless survey crew<br />
  Who started in the summertime with cares that are ever few&mdash;<br />
  The reckless men who tame the wild, encamping around its throne;<br />
  We tried to think, but gave it up and waited the end alone.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  We struggled when at first it came, the foe that had<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dogged our trail;<br />
  But struggling turned to weariness; we knew that we<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;soon must fail.<br />
  The very atmosphere seemed full of death in its every form,<br />
  And one by one the fellows to Eternity's rest were borne.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  A teamster started back for help; we wondered it never came.<br />
  Found frozen in the wilderness, his horses had fallen lame.<br />
  The wolves or devil's imps from hell had scented him<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in his plight;<br />
  Watching him far in the silence, fighting his desperate fight.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Young Johnson was the first to go; we buried him by the hill,<br />
  Farewelling to endless silence, the boy lying quiet and still.<br />
  The first, I said!  God in Heaven, how many have gone<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;since then!<br />
  An axeman made the number nine, the transitman made it ten.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  With caches burned and water bad, and fever upon our trail,<br />
  We tried to return ere winter would grip us within the veil.<br />
  Wondering who was selected, soon to have yielded the price,<br />
  The price of a nation's comfort, a deal with the loaded dice.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  At last 'twas only Joe and me with Cromarty and the pup,<br />
  With faces soft as putty and a hope we had given up.<br />
  I thought of Green whom we'd never seen since starting<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;away for help,<br />
  And wondered if our bones they'd find in Spring when<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the snow should melt.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  When at last we could fight no more, blinded and<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fevered and ill,<br />
  Envying little Johnson, who was sleeping beside the hill,<br />
  We stretched our hands and tried to speak; forever<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;good-bye we said,<br />
  Surrendering to the wilderness, and praying we'd soon be dead.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Looking back over all the years, it seemed that I died that night,<br />
  Leaving the silence and anguish, the moon that was shining bright.<br />
  Found by an Indian trapper, cared for by hearts that were true,<br />
  Wresting us far from the shadow, nursed by the squaws<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the Sioux.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Sitting to-day in a smoker, viewing the oldest survey,<br />
  Don't feel inclined to discredit things I have tried to portray.<br />
  God only knows of the hardness, blizzards that robbed<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;us of sight,<br />
  Stumbling on with an effort, turning the day into night.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  This is the story of fellows lying afar in the gloom,<br />
  The fellows who never faltered, e'en on the edge of the doom.<br />
  Trying to smile through the fever, knowing the finish<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had come;<br />
  Giving their lives in the service, losing the fight they<br />

  THE HOME TRAIL<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  <i>When you've tired of trails and treasure,<br />
  Drunk the dregs of pain and pleasure,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you're camped beside the firelight all alone.<br />
  Have you heard the voices murm'ring<br />
  Things that set your soul a-yearning,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looked a-slantways at the trail and dreamed of home?<br />
  Have you seemed to see the faces,<br />
  Midst the awful lonely places,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the ones you love the best grow sad and old,<br />
  Who have waited, prayed and trusted,<br />
  While you've sought and fought and lusted<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the tinselled, luring treasure men call gold?</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Gold you've sought, and gold you've squandered,<br />
  As the world your feet have wandered,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While your folks in nightly rev'rence breathed your name.<br />
  Now you seem to hear them speaking,<br />
  "Father, safe into Thy keeping,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take our boy, and bring him safely home again."<br />
  As you dream, the vision's alt'ring,<br />
  And you see a figure falt'ring<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the rustic gate where last you said goodbye.<br />
  Patient eyes the years are dimming,<br />
  Through your soul her cry is ringing,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, my boy, just once again before I die!"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Through the mist of mem'ry's waking<br />
  Things you've long forgot are breaking,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scenes reflected in the campfire's lonely glow.<br />
  As you curse the lonely places,<br />
  Long for old familiar faces,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the world you left a wand'rer long ago.<br />
  Calling: "Leave it all behind you,<br />
  Snap the lonely thongs that bind you,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are waiting in the village o'er the foam."&mdash;<br />
  Ghostly voices softly murm'ring,<br />
  As from wilderness you're turning,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And your snowshoes print the backward trail for home.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Twas a dream, but now you're speeding,<br />
  For you've heard the whispered pleading,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all else is fading far into the gloom.<br />
  With your pulses madly throbbing,<br />
  "Mother, don't, ah, don't be sobbing,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've remembered, and I'm coming to you soon."<br />
  Trail by day, far in the twilight,<br />
  Camping, still, beneath the starlight,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving far behind a dim and lonely land,<br />
  Till you see the white cliffs gleaming,<br />
  Where it's home, and past the dreaming,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you watch the wavelets breaking on the sand.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  As you see the ivy clinging,<br />
  Hear the robin-redbreast singing,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the land you left is still the same to-day;<br />
  Midst the scenes you've dreamed of often,<br />
  As the whisp'ring breezes soften,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a moment desp'rate years are rolled away.<br />
  While the crimson sun is setting,<br />
  Trails and hardness you're forgetting,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For beside the rose-wreathed cottage on the hill,<br />
  'Neath the locks that years are whit'ning<br />
  Loving eyes are softly bright'ning,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the home land there's a welcome for you still.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  <i>P'r'aps you know that back you'll wander,<br />
  To the lone land over yonder,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the birth of nations still a part you'll play.<br />
  And perhaps be glad to listen,<br />
  When the voice demands submission,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turn again and wander exiled on your way.<br />
  But you catch a whispered murm'ring,<br />
  "Dad, thank God our boy's returning,"<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Closely clasp the feeble figures to your breast.<br />
  God, it's all that really matters,<br />
  And her voice the fancy shatters,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the trail has led you home, a-while to rest.</i><br />

  YESTERDAY<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  There's a land we knew in the days gone by,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And builded our castles there.<br />
  There are trails we trod in the dawning light,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With never a thought of care.<br />
  There were dreams we dreamed, there were plans we planned.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But lingered upon our way.<br />
  As we trod midst a halo of glory<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The morning of yesterday.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  For our hearts were light, and the way was bright,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What matter the day was long.<br />
  Cloudless years were ours, and the shady bowers<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Re-echoed our blithesome song.<br />
  At the warning cry, as they passed us by,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We mocked, for our hearts were gay&mdash;<br />
  Solemn plodders who passed us at noontide,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The noontide of yesterday.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Did we linger long, ah, 'twas sweet to do<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-morrow, we said with pride.<br />
  For the way was steep, and we laid to sleep<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dream where the trails divide.<br />
  But the sun was low, as we rose to go,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ah, it was cold and grey,<br />
  While the shadows of even were falling&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evening of yesterday.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  For the land of dreams is the long ago,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where shadowy phantoms tread<br />
  Of a task undone and a prize unwon,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gift that at noonday fled.<br />
  Though we turn again to its sunlit plain,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The glories are dimmed for aye,<br />
  And our castles are mingled with ashes.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ashes of yesterday.<br />

  (A Song of the Brand)<br />

<p class="poem">
  <i>They who bear the brand of the lonely land<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must follow its lonely way<br />
  Through the long, long night, till the dawning light<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall herald the break of day.<br />
  Cross the Arctic snows, where the north wind blows,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or parched 'neath a burning sky,<br />
  To a call that was theirs since creation<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They answer and know not why.</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I chain with the fetters that bind the soul,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I link with the links of time<br />
  And speak ere the cradle shall yield its child;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I claim thee and thou art mine.<br />
  From palatial pomp to the reeking slum,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Midst classes and kinds I roam.<br />
  And I trust to their keeping mine honour,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Midst trails of the great alone.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  How they smile with joy o'er the baby boy,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And plan him a future grand.<br />
  But I watch unseen, as I stand between,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To letter him with the brand.<br />
  Then I creep away to await the day<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When idols and hopes shall fall,<br />
  And a wanderer turns to the desert,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obeying my deathless call.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  There are those who try to my power deny,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defying my ancient law.<br />
  Who would e'en be free, as they turn to flee<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again to the paths of yore.<br />
  As I watch them go, in my heart I know<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis but to return again.<br />
  For the things that are, and the things that were<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To them are no more the same.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  They are mine for aye till their bones decay,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And others shall fill their trail.<br />
  They are mine to seek by the gorge and creek,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The South, or the Northland's veil.<br />
  They are mine to live, they are mine to die,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Predestined by fate's decree<br />
  To a choice that is not of their choosing,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet willing my sons to be.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  For the seed is sown and they e'en must roam<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My boundaries wild and wide<br />
  Till I bid them rest from an endless quest,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sleep where the trails divide.<br />
  In the nameless graves where the big grass waves<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shadows of empire fall<br />
  They are sleeping the sleep of the ages,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awaiting the last great call.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  <i>'Twas so at the first, 'twill be to the last,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wanderer still must roam.<br />
  For the fates decreed that the gypsy breed<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forever must trail alone.<br />
  In the silent land by the lonely fire,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Midst wilderness old and grey,<br />
  They are blending with dreams of to-morrow<br />

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
